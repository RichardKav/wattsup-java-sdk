Wattsup Original Manufacturer Software
=======

Some of the original software which was provided with WattsUp Meters, is provided here. The manufacturer [went out of business](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/wu-pro/) and the only place the software could be obtained was on their website.
The software here is provided as is on the understanding that no further support is expected and that its sole aim is to provide the binaries that can no longer be provided by the original source and as such this software should be treated as abandonware. 
The Linux Utility was originally created and posted on a [forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20130623210759/https://www.wattsupmeters.com/forum/index.php?topic=8.0) provided by Patrick Mochel, please see the readme inside the Linux utility zip file for details.
