Wattsup Original Manufacturer Manuals
=======

Some of the original manuals which was provided with WattsUp Meters, are provided here. The manufacturer [went out of business](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/wu-pro/) and the only place the manuals could be obtained was on their website.
The manuals provided here are useful for understanding the comunication protocols that the Wattsup-java-sdk uses and are therefore provided here.
